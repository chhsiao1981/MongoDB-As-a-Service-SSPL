# MongoDB-As-a-Service-SSPL

[English](README.en.md) \
[Traditional Chinese](README.zh-hant.md)

MongoDB-As-A-Service-SSPL is a MongoDB-based service intended to follow SSPL.
The purpose of this repository is:

1. With affordable budgeting (as low as $5/mo), we can publicly implement MongoDB-as-a-Service and follow SSPL.
2. As AGPLv3, SSPL can be implemented based on copyleft spirit.
3. To clarify the scope to open source in the Section 13 of SSPL, as stewarded by MongoDB.com.
4. It is with the hope that MongoDB.com can follow what their claimed, that SSPL is really for the FLOSS community, not only for their own profit.
5. It is with the hope that with this repository, MongoDB.com can fine tune the content of the Section 13 of SSPL, and adopt the fine-tuned version of SSPL in the next version of [MongoDB Community Edition](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo).
6. It is with the hope that with the fine-tuned version of the Section 13 of SSPL, the next version of SSPL can be accepted by OSI.
7. SSPL can benefit both the for-profit entities that seek for profit and the sustainable non-profit entities that seek for other purposes.
