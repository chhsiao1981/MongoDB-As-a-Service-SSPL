# FAQ

1. Why do you want to do this?
    * I want to show that SSPL is truly for FLOSS community, not just for some company's profit.
2. What's your source of funding?
    * With affordable budgeting, I fund by myself.
3. Are you competing against MongoDB.com?
    * Ideally no, I do admire that they try to prove that the projects with copyleft licenses can be financially successful in this era.
    * As several other open-source projects, it is expected that the quality of service of this project depends on the donation/payment
      system and the donation/payment from the general public. Ideally it is expected that the quality of service by MongoDB.com is much better than this project.
    * Furthermore, I believe this repo is to advertise the superiorsity of MongoDB, and have the users appreciate the quality of service provided by MongoDB.com.
4. Doesn't MongoDB.com v. FerretDB.com just prove that MongoDB.com is the evil one?
    * MongoDB.com v. FerretDB.com is irrelevant to SSPL.
    * It's MongoDB.com and FerretDB.com's business strategies, irrelevant to SSPL, open source licenses, and FLOSS communities.
    * I don't like illegal plagiarism either, as FerretDB was originally named as "[MangoDB](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/qlyalj/mangodb_a_truly_open_source_mongodb_alternative/) ([MangoDB-io/MangoDB](https://github.com/MangoDB-io/MangoDB))" (not a typo)ï½ž
    * I do respect patent law, copyright law, trademark law, and intellectual property.
5. If you do respect patent law, copyright law, trademark law, and intellectual property, then why do you care about copyleft?
    * Although the FSF/GNU emphasizes on the differences among the three laws and [discourage the term "intellectual property"](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/not-ipr.html),
      perhaps due to my stupidity, cultural differences, or translation issues, I don't feel they are that different, and I respect the so-called "intellectual property".
    * Although I have a different philosophy than the FSF/GNU, I do respect [their view on copyleft](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/copyleft.en.html).
    * I believe that the copyleft issues should be resolved in the copyleft way, with the exception that the copyright owner should be respected.
    * As mentioned in [00-Motivation.md](./00-Motivation.md), I feel that the definition of "covered work" in the AGPLv3 will take too much time and effort to debate in court. I feel that the SSPL is more practical.
