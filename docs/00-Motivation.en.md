# Motivation

I have been using MongoDB since MongoDB 2.2 in 2013. Based on my observations, I assume and admire that MongoDB.com wants to show that copyleft (AGPLv3) can be applied commercially in this era, [which is what the FSF/GNU agrees with](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling.html), even though it may contradict some people's philosophies.

After seeing their almost failure in pre-MongoDB 2.4 and the dramatical change in fortune [after acquiring WiredTiger as their core in MongoDB 3.0](https://www.mongodb.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/wired-tiger), I feel that I understood [their need to transition from AGPLv3 to SSPL](https://www.mongodb.com/company/newsroom/press-releases/mongodb-issues-new-server-side-public-license-for-mongodb-community-server) after they finally successfully deployed their cloud service with [MongoDB 3.6 in 2017-12](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo/tree/r3.6.0) but [Amazon claimed "DocumentDB 3.6" with "engine patch 1.0"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/release-notes.html#release-notes.06-30-2020) WITH COMPLETELY CLOSED-SOURCE right after MongoDB.com's deployment (already present [in Alibaba's article in 2018-02](https://www.alibabacloud.com/blog/Alibaba-Cloud-Product-Comparison-for-AWS-Professionals_444958)).

To my understanding, the original intent of SSPL was to [make the AGPLv3 definition of "covered work", which is "a work based on the Program", more concrete in the context of "Remote Network Interaction"](https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review_lists.opensource.org/2018-December/003863.html). Furthermore:
* SSPL specifically restricts "the precondition triggering SSPL" as "making the the functionality of the Program as a service (directly) available to third parties (["What are the implications of this new license on applications built using MongoDB and made available as a service (SaaS)?"](https://www.mongodb.com/legal/licensing/server-side-public-license/faq))".
* Like AGPLv3, if SSPL is triggered, the only requirement is to open source (Section 8), not the total prohibition ([Confluent Community License](https://www.confluent.io/confluent-community-license/)), or any other requirement.

However, because the content of SSPLv1 did not precisely reflect the intent ([ex: do I also need to have OS / firmware be SSPL](https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review_lists.opensource.org/2018-October/003654.html)? or what are licenses of the components of the "covered work" compatible to SSPL? or what kinds of components need to be licensed as SSPLv1 as well?), [OSI officially claimed that "SSPL is NOT an Open Source License"](https://opensource.org/blog/the-sspl-is-not-an-open-source-license).

Recently several events occured that were remotely related to SSPL. These events include [Elastic](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/blob/v8.16.0/LICENSE.txt) and [Redis](https://github.com/redis/redis/blob/8.0.1/LICENSE.txt) adopting triple-licensed, [the discussion of copyleft / open source licenses at COSCUP 2025](https://github.com/lucienchlin/slides/blob/main/2025/20250809-COSCUP2025-Legal_Considerations_for_Open_Source_Program_Office_Collaboration.pdf), [MongoDB.com v. FerretDB.com](https://www.mongodb.com/company/blog/building-for-developers-not-imitators) (whic, to my understanding, is not because of SSPL), and [Microsoft donated documentdb to the Linux Foundation](https://opensource.microsoft.com/blog/2025/08/25/documentdb-joins-the-linux-foundation/). I sense a widespread misconception about SSPL among the general public, and the need for a demo deployment to demonstrate that SSPL is truly for the FLOSS community, and not merely for some company's profit.

I also recognize the risk that the SSPL may still be just MongoDB.com's ironic scam in doing proprietary by using copyleft. I am willing to take this risk, with the hope that instead of publicly defaming or suing the contributors of this repository, MongoDB.com will be willing to improve the license and make SSPL a truly feasible license applicable to the FLOSS community.
